If you are interested in helping with MCreator development, you are welcome to support this project by 
opening pull requests. Even if you do not code, you can help by contributing translations, in-app tips, or
by [donating](https://mcreator.net/donate).

# Tips

* A good starting point into contributing is fixing or adding one of the features or bug reports from the issue tracker
* Before contributing new features into MCreator, consider opening a pull request draft, so we can discuss the suggested 
changes, and the way how to implement them to fit the existing code base and UX flow as good as possible.
* Try to follow existing code style, naming conventions, and UI/UX philosophy as much as possible
* When committing, make sure to reference the issue by #ID in the commit message to link commits to the issue
* Reference potential issues the pull request relates to when an issue(s) related to the pull request exists
* Make sure to update files with license headers

# CLA

Before we can use your code, you must sign the [MCreator CLA](https://cla-assistant.io/Pylo/MCreator), which you can do online.
The CLA is necessary mainly because you own the copyright to your changes, even after your contribution 
becomes part of our codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. We also need to be sure 
of various other thingsâ€”for instance that you'll tell us if you know that your code infringes on other people's patents. 
You don't have to sign the CLA until after you've submitted your code for review and we approved it, but you must do it before
 we can put your code into our codebase.
